👋 Hi, I'm Derek Johnston, an Indigenous cybersecurity enthusiast from Saskatchewan, Canada. I navigate the digital world with ADHD and schizophrenia, proving that unique perspectives lead to powerful innovations.

💡 As a self-taught cybersecurity expert holding CompTIA Security+, I specialize in crafting Python scripts for hacking, cybersecurity, OSINT, and automation. My software is open-source, a testament to my commitment to community-driven solutions.

🌐 I'm also a web developer fluent in Python, PHP, and HTML, with a knack for creating dynamic websites. My passion lies in building tools that empower users in the digital realm.

🔐 Among my creations are hacking scripts stress-testing lockout policies and tools for password spraying. I've even developed bulk emailing software, streamlining communication with the masses.

👪 Currently seeking opportunities, I rely on your support to sustain my family, including my new son and wife. Donations are immensely appreciated:
