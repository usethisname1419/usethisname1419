My name is Derek Johnston and I'm a self taught programmer. I've been using 
Computers for only about a year because I was in prison for 10 years. Ive 
Dedicated myself to stop bad actors and stop cyber criminals. I'm studying cyber
Security to get myself certified, to help me find a job in IT and Tech.

I put everything I have into tuition and hopefully I can find work.
If you can work with me to help me build these tools

If you have any work available I will work for $10 per hour

Donations are welcome and appreciated, I put all my money into school and my wife is 
Pregnant and I have no job
